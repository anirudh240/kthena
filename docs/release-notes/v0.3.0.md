# Release v0.3.0

Released: 2026-01-31

## Summary

Release v0.3.0 establishes Kthena as a more robust and scalable platform for AI inference workloads. This release introduces significant enhancements in ModelServing, Router, and ModelBooster. Key highlights include seamless integration with **LeaderWorkerSet**, advanced **network topology-aware scheduling** for PD disaggregation, and a comprehensive **Router Observability** framework. Additionally, this version brings native **ModelServing version control**, support for **vLLM data parallel deployment**, and a complete E2E test suite for the router, ensuring high stability and reliability for production environments.

## What's New

### Key Features Overview

- **LeaderWorkerSet Support**: Integration with the **LeaderWorkerSet (LWS)** API allows for sophisticated management of distributed inference workloads.
- **Role-Level Gang Scheduling & Topology Awareness**: Leverages Volcano's new `subGroupPolicy` feature to enable fine-grained, **role-based gang scheduling** and **network topology awareness**.
- **ModelServing Partition Revision Control**: Introduced a native revision-based version control system for ModelServing.
- **Router Observability & Debugging**: Comprehensive documentation and framework for router observability, plus a dedicated debug port.
- **Enhanced Rolling Updates**: Support for `maxUnavailable` allows tuning the velocity of updates for faster rollouts.
- **Plugin Support**: Flexible plugin architecture for ModelServing to inject custom configuration logic.

### LeaderWorkerSet Support for ModelServing Role

**Background and Motivation**:
Distributed inference workloads often require complex topologies where a leader pod manages multiple worker pods. Configuring these relationships manually can be error-prone. By integrating with the Kubernetes LeaderWorkerSet (LWS) API, Kthena simplify the deployment and management of these workloads.

**Key Capabilities**:

- **Direct Integration**: ModelServing Roles can now leverage LWS to automatically manage leader-worker groups.
- **Simplified Topology**: Reduces the complexity of defining distributed inference services requiring strict coordination.

### Role-Level Gang Scheduling & Topology Awareness

**Background and Motivation**:
In Prefill-Decode (PD) separation scenarios, the communication overhead between prefill and decode instances is critical. Ensuring these instances are scheduled closer together (e.g., on the same switch or rack) significantly improves performance.

**Key Capabilities**:

- **Role-Based Constraints**: Configure topology constraints specifically for distinct Roles (e.g., placing Prefill and Decode pods close to each other).
- **SubGroup Policies**: Utilizes Volcano's `subGroupPolicy` for precise control over gang scheduling at the subgroup level.
- **Performance Optimization**: Maximizes network bandwidth utilization and reduces latency for intensive inference jobs.

**Note**: Utilizing `subGroupSize` requires Volcano v1.14+.

### ModelServing Partition Revision Control

**Background and Motivation**:
Managing configuration changes in production AI services is critical for stability. The new version control system allows users to track history and roll back if necessary, providing a safety net for model updates.

**Key Capabilities**:

- **Revision Tracking**: Automatically tracks changes to ModelServing configurations.
- **Partition Protection**: Supports partition-based updates to ensure service continuity during rollouts.
- **Rollback**: Easily revert to a previous stable revision.

### Router Observability & Debugging

**Background and Motivation**:
Deep visibility into the inference router is essential for diagnosing latency issues and ensuring SLA compliance. The new observability framework and debug port provide the necessary tools for operators.

**Key Capabilities**:

- **Debug Port**: A dedicated port (default `15000`) for real-time inspection of routing tables and upstream health.
- **Comprehensive Metrics**: Detailed documentation and setup for monitoring request latency, throughput, and error rates.
- **E2E Testing**: A robust E2E test framework covering most routing scenarios ensures reliability.
